		<h1>WSP Analysis of OCCS</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Client: Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services<a href="www.orlandocleaning.com"> www.orlandocleaner.com</a></li>
			<li>Project: Website Make-Over</li>
			<li>Project Lead: Jacob Ritenour</li>
			<li>Project Name: Analysis</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>The want of this company is to get the public to see the services that they provide and to insure the public that they are better that the next cleaning service they look at. I do not believe they are accomplishing this due to how "unclean" the website is. The company is attempting to gain the trust and business of the people that view this site and say "Let me show you how good of a job we do so you can tell your friends and family." </p>
			
			<p>When a person goes to this site they are looking for a company that will come into their home and take care of business respectfully and carefully. To take care of the homeowners property and make sure everything is done to the best job that it can be done. This man or woman wants to navigate the site with ease and not have to search for directions on the home page of how to get where to see examples or comments others have written. The users want to see images that are in a good placement and good quality not jumbled up or crammed in a in too small of a space. The user wants to see organization and cleanliness above all.</p>
			
			<p>This site should be easy to browse and navigate. At this time the site is extremely cluttered and there is no general pathing to locate anything on the page. When I attempted to validate the HTML, I found 49 errors. This site has a crowd of logos and images that could be placed in more strategic positions or just removed altogether. With my design, I will insure the site has a smooth flow and is easy on the eyes to any person that goes to the site. </p>
		
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://mollymaid55.reachlocal.com/?scid=876215&amp;kw=40334&amp;pub_cr_id=2998836261">Molly Maid</a></li>
			</ul>
				<p>This company reaches out to those hard everyday workers. These individuals who run out of time to do the cleaning on their own. By putting a hand out to the people knowing that life changes. Providing a  span of time that this company has been in business puts rest to the fearful minded. I like he fact that this website is not crowded and gives a direction to those who visit it.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://mycleaninglady2.reachlocal.net">My Cleaning Lady</a></li>
			</ul>
				<p>Again reaching out to those with a busy lifestyle. This site has primary information in the direct view when you go to the page. As well as providing more of a background story in the lower portion of the index page. Also having a "Free Estimate" area is a great idea. I would think about adding one to the redesigned site.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.collegegirlcleaningservice.com">College Girl Cleaning Service</a></li>
			</ul>
				<p>This company on the other hand has a few things that I would not recommend. The "loud" colors could vier others away because it may be too much for some people's eyes. Also the name of the company can be thought of being a bit provocative. I do understand that it may just be a name but a name says a lot. I would need to gather a few references before I used this company. From a layout stand point the design is very well built and it has a great flow.</p>
		
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Wendy Smith</li>
			</ul>
					<p>Wendy is a stay at home mom of 4 that it physically disabled. She finds it very difficult to do any kind of deep carpet cleaning even though she is in her early 30's. She looks online using her Mobile phone and laptop computer, often looking for anything that will assist her in her day to day duties like cleaning. Her husband is a program designer for a well known company and brings in about about $120,000 a year and likes quality services for the cost.</p>
			<ul>		
				<li>Carl Baker</li>
			</ul>
					<p>Carl is a US Army Veteran who is single and his children have moved to have a family of their own. He lives in a 1 bedroom home with his 2 dogs who shed constantly. Carl now works as a mechanic at a local oil change shop which pays all of his necessary bills and does not leave a whole lot of extra money.</p>
